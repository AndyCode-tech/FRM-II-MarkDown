# Ch.22 Credit Scoring And Rating
## Credit Scoring and Rating Systems
- Smaller business and individuals use credit score (300-850) → higher score, higher ability to repay
- Large business and governments use credit rating (AAA,AA etc)
- Four benefits to use credit scoring/ rating
	1. Reduces subjectivity in loan evaluation and acceptance 
	2. Enables analysis in credit risk management (scenario analysis and stress testing)
	3. Promotes transparency and consistency through a common 	framework
	4. Reduces time for and cost of appraisal 
- The systems can be developed either internally or externally 
- Bank have own system to accept or rejet loans
- Can use historical data and apply an understanding of what has worked well in the past
- Four external vendors (S&P's, Moody's, Fitch, Rating and Investment (R&I))
## Type of Credit Rating Systems
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has distinguished two high-level types of credit rating philosophies as follows:
- **Through-the cycle approach**
	- Used by major credit rating agencies → has a long-term orientation
	- Covers at least on full business cycle
	- Ratings are not updated frequently → less sensitive to short-term events → suit for long-term loans
- **Point-in-time approach**
	- Used by internal processes at a credit institution or a bank
	- Focuses on the current scenario and may widen the time period up to one year
	- More volatile since they are influenced by short-term events 
	- Capture default risk close to real-time
	- Suit for short-term loans 

## Developing Credit Scoring and Rating Models
- Credit cores and ratings can be determined for either a specific issuer (borrower) or for a specific issuance (loan/bond)
- An issuer is most likely to seek a credit score/rating when they want to borrow money (provide a proof)
### Two different scoring methods
1. Behavioural Scoring:
	- Applies to consumer loans (credit card maybe?)
	- Process of observing the historical financial behaviour of existing customers
	- Short-term measure → updates in real-time to new behavioural information observed (pay
	- May used with credit limits, manageing debt collection, and marketing new products
2. Profit scoring:
	- Focues only on the estimated profitability of a loan (loan pricing, operational decision, credit risk assessments and default predictions
	- First type: **Account-level** → calculates profit for each individual account and ignores any connections between multiple accounts
	- Second type: **Customer-level** → Explicitly considers all accounts owned by a customers → enables the profit perspective to be aggregated across any accounts associated with a specific customer

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the intech industry have enabled social lending (a.k.a. peer-to-peer lending), which is a transaction directly between a lender and a borrower without the need for a inancial intermediary. Credit decisions can be made very quickly, but credit risk modeling in social lending is still an emerging topic. More needs to be done to understand the risks in this lending channel, which often has higher default rates than intermediated loans. The responsible use of big data and transparency are material concerns with this innovation.

# Credit Rating Agency Methodologies

 ## Basel Committee 5 basic specification about credit scoring and rating systems
 1. Meaningful differentiation of risk
	 - Credit grades must be established based on risk differences and not as an attemot to manage regulatory capital requirements.
	 - Borrowers in the same credit grade may be treated differently based on transaction-level differences.
	 - A reasonable dispersion across credit grades to avoid concentration in any specific credit grade

2. Continuous evaluation of borrowers
	- Ratings should be updated on a reasonable basis
	- No less frequent than an annual rerating review (at least annual review)

3. Operational oversight
	- Ensure adequate system integrity
	- The credit scoring/rating system should be continuously monitored for proper functioning, efficient controls (stress testing) and adequate feedback from associated parties

4. Correct selection of risk assessment metrics
	- Risk factors analyzed should adequately predict the creditworthiness of the borrower
	- Make estimated are closes as possible to the actual outcomes

5. Collecting substantial data
	- The data used must represent reality
	- The credit grading must incorporate historical data, past credit scores/ratings, prior default estimates and payment history.

# Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Dataset include performing loans and non-performing loans for more than 90-days
- Some of the data may requires preprocessing to eliminate outliers
- Selecting the most appropriate risk attributes for analysis, transforming data as needed
- Remove subjectivity from this process and introduce as much consistency as possible
- For consumer: should include borrower's income, asset, existing loan obligations, payment history, employment status, use of collateral/guarantees, type of loan (auto loan, credit card, mortgage

- For Corporate customers
	- Financial data
		- Corporate financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cashflows)
		- Profitability ratios: estimate the ability to repay. These ratios include return on asset (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and profit margins.
		- Solvency ratios:
