# Ch.22 Credit Scoring And Rating
## Credit Scoring and Rating Systems
- Smaller business and individuals use credit score (300-850) → higher score, higher ability to repay
- Large business and governments use credit rating (AAA,AA etc)
- Four benefits to use credit scoring/ rating
	1. Reduces subjectivity in loan evaluation and acceptance 
	2. Enables analysis in credit risk management (scenario analysis and stress testing)
	3. Promotes transparency and consistency through a common 	framework
	4. Reduces time for and cost of appraisal 
- The systems can be developed either internally or externally 
- Bank have own system to accept or rejet loans
- Can use historical data and apply an understanding of what has worked well in the past
- Four external vendors (S&P's, Moody's, Fitch, Rating and Investment (R&I))
## Type of Credit Rating Systems
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) has distinguished two high-level types of credit rating philosophies as follows:
- **Through-the cycle approach**
	- Used by major credit rating agencies → has a long-term orientation
	- Covers at least on full business cycle
	- Ratings are not updated frequently → less sensitive to short-term events → suit for long-term loans
- **Point-in-time approach**
	- Used by internal processes at a credit institution or a bank
	- Focuses on the current scenario and may widen the time period up to one year
	- More volatile since they are influenced by short-term events 
	- Capture default risk close to real-time
	- Suit for short-term loans 

## Developing Credit Scoring and Rating Models
- Credit cores and ratings can be determined for either a specific issuer (borrower) or for a specific issuance (loan/bond)
- An issuer is most likely to seek a credit score/rating when they want to borrow money (provide a proof)
### Two different scoring methods
1. Behavioural Scoring:
	- Applies to consumer loans
